# Psychology And Life 《心理学与生活》

## Psychology and Life

why should you study psychology? The answer to that question is quite straightforward. Psychological  research has immediate and crucial applications to important issues of eve- ryday experience: your physical and mental health, your ability to form and sustain close relationships, and your capacity for learning and personal growth. One of the foremost goals of Psychology and Life is to highlight the personal relevance   and social significance of psychological  expertise. 

The challenge of introductory psychology is to bring the products of scientific research to bear on questions that matter to you.

We will inquire about the how, what, when, and why of human behavior and about the causes and consequences of behaviors you observe in yourself, in other people, and in animals. We will consider why you think, feel, and behave as you do. What makes you uniquely different from all other people? Yet why do you often behave so much like others? Are you molded by heredity, or are you shaped more by personal experiences? How can aggression and altruism, love and hate, and mental illness and creativity exist side by side in this complex creature—the human animal? In this opening chapter, we ponder how and why all these types of questions have become relevant to psychology’s goals as a discipline.

### WHAT MAKES PSYCHOLOGY UNIQUE?

#### Definition

Many psychologists seek answers to this fundamental question: What is human nature? Psychology answers this question by looking at processes that occur within individuals as well as forces that arise within the physical and social environment. In this light, we’ll define psychology as the scientific study of the behavior of individuals and their mental processes. Let’s explore the critical parts of this definition: scientific, behavior, individual, and mental 

##### scientific
The scientific aspect of psychology requires that psychological conclusions be based on evidence collected according to the principles of the scientific method. The scientific method consists of a set of orderly steps used to analyze and solve problems. This method uses objectively collected information as the factual basis for drawing conclusions.  

##### Behavior 
Behavior is the means by which organisms adjust to their environment. Behavior is action. The subject matter of psychology largely consists of the observable behavior of humans and other species of animals. Smiling, crying, running, hitting, talking, and touching are some obvious examples of behavior you can observe. Psychologists examine what the individual does and how the individual goes about doing it within a given behavioral setting and in the broader social or cultural context 

##### Individual
The subject of psychological analysis is most often an individual. An individual might be studied in its natural habitat or in the controlled conditions of a research laboratory

##### Mental
Many researchers in psychology also recognize that they cannot understand human actions without also understanding mental processes, the workings of the human mind. Much human activity takes place as private, internal events—thinking, planning, reasoning, creating, and dreaming. Many psychologists believe that mental processes represent the most important aspect of psychological inquiry.

The combination of these concerns defines psychology as a unique field. Within the social sciences, psychologists focus largely on the behavior of individuals in various settings, whereas sociologists study social behavior of groups or institutions, and anthropologists focus on the broader context of behavior in different cultures. Even so, psychologists draw broadly from the insights of other scholars.     

psychology The scientific study of the behavior of individuals and their mental processes. 

scientific method The set of procedures used for gathering and interpreting objective information in a way that minimizes error and yields dependable generalizations. 

behavior The actions by which an organism adjusts to its environment     

The best way to learn about the field is to learn to share psychologists’ goals. Let’s consider those goals.

#### The Goals of Psychology

The goals of the psychologist conducting basic research are to describe, explain, predict, and control behavior. These goals form the basis of the psychological enterprise. 

##### Describing What Happens

The first task in psychology is to make accurate observations about behavior. Psychologists typically refer to such observations as their data (data is the plural, datum the singular). Behavioral data are reports of observations about the behavior of organisms and the conditions under which the behavior occurs. When researchers undertake data collection, they must choose an appropriate level of analysis and devise measures of behavior that ensure objectivity.

To investigate an individual’s behavior, researchers may use different levels of analysis—from the broadest, most global level down to the most minute, specific level. 

Suppose, for example, you were trying to describe a painting you saw at a museum (see Figure 1.1 on page 4). At a global level, you might describe it by title, Bathers, and by artist, Georges Seurat. At a more specific level, you might recount features of the painting: Some people are sunning themselves on a riverbank while others are enjoying the water, and so on. At a very specific level, you might describe the technique Seurat used—tiny points of paint—to create the scene. The description at each level would answer different questions about the painting.

Different levels of psychological description also address different questions.Each level of analysis yields information essential to the final composite portrait of human nature that psychologists hope ultimately to develop.

##### Explaining What Happens

hereas descriptions must stick to perceivable information, explanations deliberately go beyond what can be observed. In many areas of psychology, the central goal is to find regular patterns in behavioral and mental processes. Psychologists want to discover how behavior works.      

Explanations in psychology usually recognize that most behavior is influenced by a combination of factors.       

Often a psychologist’s goal is to explain a wide variety of behavior in terms of one underlying cause.         

To forge such causal explanations, researchers must often engage in a creative process of examining a diverse collection of data. Master detective Sherlock Holmes drew shrewd conclusions from scraps of evidence.  

In a similar fashion, every researcher must use an informed imagination, which creatively synthesizes what is known and what is not yet known. A welltrained psychologist can explain observations by using her or his insight into the human experience along with the facts previous researchers have uncovered about the phenomenon in question. Much psychological research is an attempt to give accurate explanations for different behavioral patterns.

##### Predicting What Will Happen

Predictions in psychology are statements about the likelihood that a certain behavior will occur or that a given relationship will be found. Often an accurate explanation of the causes underlying some form of behavior will allow a researcher to make accurate predictions about future behavior. 

When different explanations are put forward to account for some behavior or relationship, they are usually judged by how well they can make accurate and comprehensive predictions.

Just as observations must be made objectively, scientific predictions must be worded precisely enough to enable them to be tested and then rejected if the evidence does not support them. 

To improve future predictions, a researcher would create systematic variations in environmental conditions and observe their influence on the baby’s response.

#####  Controlling What Happens 

For many psychologists, control is the central, most powerful goal. Control means making behavior happen or not happen—starting it, maintaining it, stopping it, and influencing its form, strength, or rate of occurrence. A causal explanation of behavior is convincing if it can create conditions under which the behavior can be controlled.        

The ability to control behavior is important because it gives psychologists ways of helping people improve the quality of their lives. 

In this respect, psychologists are a rather optimistic group; many believe that virtually any undesired behavior pattern can be modified by the proper intervention. Psychology and Life shares that optimism.       

### THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY

At the core of this historical review is one simple principle: Ideas matter. Much of the history of psychology has been characterized by heated debates about what constitutes the appropriate subject matter and methodologies for a science of mind and behavior.      

This historical review will be carried out at two levels of analysis. The first section will consider the period of history in which some of the critical groundwork for modern psychology was laid down. This focus will enable you to witness at close range the battle of ideas. The second section will describe in a broader fashion seven perspectives that have emerged in the modern day.

#### Psychology’s Historical Foundations

##### Structuralism: The Elements of the Mind

Psychology’s potential to make a unique contribution to knowledge became apparent when psychology became a laboratory science organized around experiments. 

Titchener’s goal was to uncover the underlying structure of the human mind by defining the component elements of an individual’s mental life. In fact, he conceived his research program in analogy to the work of chemists (1910, p. 49): “The psychologist arranges the mental elements precisely as the chemist classifies his elementary substances.” Titchener’s approach came to be known as structuralism, the study of the basic structural components of mind and behavior.
##### Functionalism: Minds With a Purpose 

William James agreed with Titchener that consciousness was central to the study of psychology. However, James focused his attention not on the elements of mental processes, but on their purpose. James wished to understand the ways in which consciousness functions to help people adapt effectively to their environments. James’s approach became known as functionalism.

structuralism: The study of the structure of mind and behavior; the view that all human mental experience can be understood as a combination of simple elements or events. 

introspection: Individuals’ systematic examination of their own thoughts and feelings. 

Gestalt psychology: A school of psychology that maintains that psychological phenomena can be understood only when viewed as organized, structured wholes, not when broken down into primitive perceptual elements. 

functionalism: The perspective on mind and behavior that focuses on the 
examination of their functions in an organism’s interactions with the environment.

John Dewey focused on the functions of reflexes, which he described as “a continuously ordered sequence of acts, all adapted in themselves and in the order of their sequence, to reach a certain objective end, the reproduction of the species, the preservation of life, locomotion to a certain place” (1896, p. 366). Dewey’s concern for the practical uses of mental processes led to important advances in education. His theorizing provided the impetus for progressive education in his own laboratory school and more generally in the United States        

##### The Legacy of These Approaches

Despite their differences, the insights of the practitioners of both structuralism and functionalism created an intellectual context in which contemporary psychology could flourish. Psychologists currently examine both the structure and the function of behavior.

##### Women as Pioneering Researchers

Since the days in which these women were pioneers, the field of psychology has changed in the direction of far greater diversity. In fact, in recent years more women than men have earned PhDs in the field (National Science Foundation, 2010). I will highlight the work of diverse researchers throughout Psychology and Life. As psychology continues to contribute to the scientific and human enterprise, more people—women and men, and members of all segments of society—are being drawn to its richness.

##### Perspectives on Psychology

In a similar fashion, psychologists’ perspectives determine the way in which they examine behavior and mental processes. The perspectives influence what psychologists look for, where they look, and what research methods they use. This section defines seven perspectives—psychodynamic, behaviorist, humanistic, cognitive, biological, evolutionary, and sociocultural. As you read the section, note how each perspective defines the causes and consequences of behavior.

###### The Psychodynamic Perspective

According to the psychodynamic perspective, behavior is driven, or motivated, by powerful inner forces. In this view, human actions stem from inherited instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and society’s demands. Deprivation states, physiological arousal, and conflicts provide the power for behavior. According to this model, the organism stops reacting when its needs are satisfied and its drives reduced. The main purpose of action is to reduce tension.         

Freud’s ideas grew out of his work with mentally disturbed patients, but he believed that the principles he observed applied to both normal and abnormal behavior. Freud’s psychodynamic theory views a person as pulled and pushed by a complex network of inner and outer forces. Freud’s model was the first to recognize that human nature is not always rational and that actions may be driven by motives that are not in conscious awareness.     

Freud himself emphasized early childhood as the stage in which personality is formed. Neo-Freudian theorists have broadened psychodynamic theory to include social influences and interactions that occur over the individual’s entire lifetime.           

psychodynamic perspective: A psychological model in which behavior is explained in terms of past experiences and motivational forces; actions are viewed as stemming from inherited instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and social requirements. 

###### The Behaviorist Perspective

Those who take the behaviorist perspective seek to understand how particular environmental stimuli control particular kinds of behavior. First, behaviorists analyze the antecedent environmental conditions—those that precede the behavior and set the stage for an organism to make a response or withhold a response. Next, they look at the behavioral response, which is the main object of study—the action to be understood, predicted, and controlled. Finally, they examine the observable consequences that follow from the response.           

Behaviorism has yielded a critical practical legacy. Its emphasis on the need for rigorous experimentation and carefully defined variables has influenced most areas of psychology. Although behaviorists have conducted much basic research with nonhuman animals, the principles of behaviorism have been widely applied to human problems.         


###### The Cognitive Perspective

behaviorist perspective: The psychological perspective primarily concerned with observable behavior that can be objectively recorded and with the relationships of  observable behavior to environmental stimuli. behaviorism A scientific approach that limits the study of psychology to measurable or observable  behavior.
humanistic perspective: A psychological model that emphasizes an individual’s phenomenal world and  inherent capacity for making rational choices and developing to maximum potential. 

cognitive perspective: The perspective on psychology that stresses human thought and the processes  of knowing, such as attending, thinking, remembering, expecting, solving problems, fantasizing, and  consciousness. 

The cognitive revolution in psychology emerged as another challenge to the limits of behaviorism. The centerpiece of the cognitive perspective is human thought and all the processes of knowing—attending, thinking, remembering, and understanding. From the cognitive perspective, people act because they think, and people think because they are human beings, exquisitely equipped to do so. According to the cognitive model, behavior is only partly determined by preceding environmental events and past behavioral consequences, as behaviorists believe. Some of the most significant behavior emerges from totally novel ways of thinking, not from predictable ways used in the past.

Cognitive psychologists study higher mental processes such as perception, memory, language use, thinking, problem solving, and decision making at a variety of levels. Cognitive psychologists view thoughts as both results and causes of overt actions         

Within the cognitive perspective, an individual responds to reality not as it is in the objective world of matter but as it is in the subjective reality of the individual’s inner world of thoughts and imagination. Because of its focus on mental processes, many researchers see the cognitive perspective as the dominant approach in psychology today

###### The Biological Perspective

The biological perspective guides psychologists who search for the causes of behavior in the functioning of genes, the brain, the nervous system, and the endocrine system. An organism’s functioning is explained in terms of underlying physical structures and biochemical processes. Experience and behaviors are largely understood as the result of chemical and electrical activities taking place within and between nerve cells.          

Researchers who take the biological perspective generally assume that psychological and social phenomena can be ultimately understood in terms of biochemical processes: Even the most complex phenomena can be understood by analysis, or reduction, into ever smaller, more specific units. Experience can modify behavior by altering these underlying biological structures and processes.

biological perspective: The approach to identifying causes of behavior that focuses on the functioning of genes, the brain, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.      

behavioral neuroscience: A multidisciplinary field that attempts to understand the brain processes that underlie behavior. cognitive neuroscience A multidisciplinary field that attempts to understand the brain processes that underlie higher cognitive functions in humans.        

evolutionary perspective: The approach to psychology that stresses the importance of behavioral and mental adaptiveness, based on the assumption that mental capabilities evolved over millions of years to serve particular adaptive purposes.

###### The Evolutionary Perspective

The evolutionary perspective seeks to connect contemporary psychology to a central idea of the life sciences, Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. The idea of natural selection is quite simple:Those organisms that are better suited to their environments tend to produce offspring (and pass on their genes) more successfully than those organisms with poorer adaptations. Over many generations, the species changes in the direction of the privileged adaptation. The evolutionary perspective in psychology suggests that mental abilities evolved over millions of years to serve particular adaptive purposes, just as physical abilities did.        

To practice evolutionary psychology, researchers focus on the environmental conditions in which the human brain evolved. Humans spent 99 percent of their evolutionary history as hunter–gatherers living in small groups during the Pleistocene era (the roughly 2-million-year period ending 10,000 years ago). Evolutionary psychology uses the rich theoretical framework of evolutionary biology to identify the central adaptive problems that faced this species: avoiding predators and parasites, gathering and exchanging food, finding and retaining mates, and raising healthy children. After identifying the adaptive problems that these early humans faced, evolutionary psychologists generate inferences about the sorts of mental mechanisms, or psychological adaptations, that might have evolved to solve those problems.    

###### The Sociocultural Perspective

Psychologists who take a sociocultural perspective study cross-cultural differences in the causes and consequences of behavior. The sociocultural perspective is an important response to the criticism that psychological research has too often been based on a Western conception of human nature and had as its subject population mostly white middle-class Americans (Arnett, 2008; Gergen et al., 1996). A proper consideration of cultural forces may involve comparisons of groups within the same national boundaries. For example, researchers may look within the United States to compare the prevalence of eating disorders for women of different races (see Chapter 11). Cultural forces may also be assessed across nationalities, as in comparisons of media reports in the United States and Japan (see Chapter 16). Cross-cultural psychologists want to determine whether the theories researchers have developed apply to all humans, or only to more narrow, specific populations.

The sociocultural perspective, therefore, suggests that some universal claims of the psychodynamic perspective are incorrect.

sociocultural perspective: The psychological perspective that focuses on cross-cultural differences in the causes and consequences of behavior.

###### Comparing Perspectives: Focus on Aggression

Psychodynamic. Analyze aggression as a reaction to frustrations caused by barriers to pleasure, such as unjust authority. View aggression as an adult’s displacement of hostility originally felt as a child against his or her parents.

Behaviorist. Identify reinforcements of past aggressive responses, such as extra attention given to a child who hits classmates or siblings. Assert that children learn from physically abusive parents to be abusive with their own children. 

Humanistic. Look for personal values and social conditions that foster self-limiting, aggressive perspectives instead of growth-enhancing, shared experiences. 

Cognitive. Explore the hostile thoughts and fantasies people experience while witnessing violent acts, noting both aggressive imagery and intentions to harm others. Study the impact of violence in films and videos, including pornographic violence, on attitudes toward gun control, rape, and war. 

Biological. Study the role of specific brain systems in aggression by stimulating different regions and then recording any destructive actions that are elicited. Also analyze the brains of mass murderers for abnormalities; examine female aggression as related to phases of the menstrual cycle. 

Evolutionary. Consider what conditions would have made aggression an adaptive behavior for early humans. Identify psychological mechanisms capable of selectively generating aggressive behavior under those conditions. 

Sociocultural. Consider how members of different cultures display and interpret aggression. Identify how cultural forces affect the likelihood of different types of aggressive behavior.

### HOW TO USE THIS TEXT

####  Study Strategies 

1. Set aside sufficient time for your reading assignments and review of class notes. This text contains much new technical information, many principles to learn, and a new glossary of terms to memorize. To master this material, you will need at least three hours of reading time per chapter. 
2. Keep a record of your study time for this course. Plot the number of hours (in half-hour intervals) you study at each reading session. Chart your time investment on a cumulative graph. Add each new study time to the previous total on the left-hand axis of the graph and each study session on the baseline axis. The chart will provide visual feedback of your progress and show you when you have not been hitting the books as you should. 
3. Be an active participant. Optimal learning occurs when you are actively involved with the learning materials. That means reading attentively, listening to lectures mindfully,paraphrasing in your own words what you are reading or hearing, and taking good notes. In the text, underline key sections, write notes to yourself in the margins, and summarize points that you think might be included on class tests. 
4. Space out your studying. Research in psychology tells us that it is more effective to do your studying regularly rather than cramming just before tests. If you let yourself fall behind, it will be difficult to catch up with all the information included in introductory psychology at lastminute panic time. 
5. Get study-centered. Find a place with minimal distractions for studying. Reserve that place for studying, reading, and writing course assignments—and do nothing else there. The place will come to be associated with study activities, and you will find it easier to work whenever you are seated at your study center.

#### Study Techniques

PQ4R: Preview, Question,Read, Reflect, Recite, and Review 

1. Preview. Skim through the chapter to get a general sense of the topics the chapter will discuss. Make yourself aware of the organization and major topics. Read the section headings and scan the photos and figures. In fact, your first stop for each chapter should be the section “Recapping Main Points.” There you will find the main ideas of the chapter organized under each of the first-level headings, which will give you a clear sense of what the chapter covers.
2. Question. For each section, make up questions. You should use the section headings and key terms to help you. For example, you might transform the heading “The Goals of Psychology” into the question “What are the goals of psychology?” You might use the key term biological perspective to generate the question, “What is the major focus of the biological perspective?” These questions will help direct your attention as you read. 
3. Read. Read the material carefully so that you are able to answer the questions you invented. 
4. Reflect. As you read the text, reflect on it to relate the material to your prior knowledge about the topics. Think of extra examples to enrich the text. Try to link the ideas together across the subsections. 
5. Recite. After you have read and reflected on a section, try to demonstrate your recall of the material as concretely as possible. For example, answer the questions you invented earlier by producing the material out loud. For later review, write down the ideas you find difficult to remember. 
6. Review. After you have read the entire chapter, review the key points. If you are unable to recall important points, or you cannot answer the questions you invented, consult the book and repeat the earlier phases (read, reflect, and recite).

### Recapping Main Points

What Makes Psychology Unique?

Psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and the mental processes of individuals.
The goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict, and help control behavior.

The Evolution of Modern Psychology

Structuralism emerged from the work of Wundt and Titchener. It emphasized the structure of the mind and behavior built from elemental sensations.
Functionalism, developed by James and Dewey, emphasized the purpose behind behavior.
Taken together, these theories created the agenda for modern psychology.
Women made substantial research contributions in psychology’s early history.
Each of the seven perspectives on psychology differs in its view of human nature, the determinants of behavior, the focus of study, and the primary research approach.
The psychodynamic perspective looks at behavior as driven by instinctive forces, inner conflicts, and conscious and unconscious motivations.
The behaviorist perspective views behavior as determined by external stimulus conditions.
The humanistic perspective emphasizes an individual’s inherent capacity to make rational choices.
The cognitive perspective stresses mental processes that affect behavioral responses.
The biological perspective studies relationships between behavior and brain mechanisms.
The evolutionary perspective looks at behavior as having evolved as an adaptation for survival in the environment.

## Research Methods in Psychology

###  THE PROCESS OF RESEARCH 21

1. generate answers to questions that matter most to students. 
2. understand how psychologists design their research.
3. improve your critical thinking skills by teaching you how to ask the right questions and evaluate the answers about the causes, consequences, and correlates of psychological phenomena.

A theory is an organized set of concepts that explains a phenomenon or set of phenomena. 

At the common core of most psychological theories is the assumption of determinism, the idea that all events—physical, mental,and behavioral—are the result of, or determined by, specificcausal factors. These causal factors are limited to those in the individual’s environment or within the person.

A hypothesis is a tentative and testable statement about the relationship between causes and consequences.

This research process is centered around appropriate uses of the scientific method. The goal of the scientific method is to allow researchers to draw conclusions with maximum objectivity. 

theory: An organized set of concepts that explains a phenomenon or set of phenomena.

determinism: The doctrine that all events—physical, behavioral, and mental—are determined by specific causal factors that are potentially knowable.

#####  Observer Biases and Operational

An observer bias is an error due to the personal motives and expectations of the viewer. At times, people see and hear what they expect rather than what is

hypothesis: A tentative and testable explanation of the relationship between two (or more) events or variables; often stated as a prediction that a certain outcome will result from specific conditions.

observer bias: The distortion of evidence because of the personal motives and expectations of the viewer.

The biases of the observers act as filters through which some things are noticed as relevant and significant and others are ignored as irrelevant and not meaningful.

To minimize observer biases, researchers rely on standardization and operational definitions. Standardization means using uniform, consistent procedures in all phases of data collection.

The strategy for standardizing the meaning of concepts is called operationalization. An operational definition standardizes meaning within an experiment, by defining a concept in terms of specific operations or procedures used to measure it or to determine its presence. All the variables in an experiment must be given operational definitions.

A variable is any factor that varies in amount or kind.

the hypothesis we considered earlier: that children who view a lot of violence on television will engage in more aggressive acts toward their peers. To test that hypothesis, you might devise an experiment in which you manipulated the amount of violence each participant viewed. That factor you manipulate would be the independent variable; it functions as the causal part of the relationship. For each level of violence viewed, you could then assess how much aggression each participant displayed. Aggression is the effect part of the causeeffect relationship; it is the dependent variable, which is what the experimenter measures. 


standardization: A set of uniform procedures for treating each
participant in a test, interview, or experiment, or for recording data.

operational definition: A definition of a variable or condition in terms of
the specific operation or procedure used to determine its presence.

variable: In an experimental setting, a factor that varies in amount
and kind.

independent variable: In an experimental setting, a variable that the
researcher manipulates with the expectation of having an impact on
values of the dependent variable.

dependent variable: In an experimental setting, a variable that the
researcher measures to assess the impact of a variation in an
independent variable.


####  Definitions Experimental Methods: Alternative Explanations and the Need for Controls Correlational Methods

To overcome causal ambiguity, researchers use experimental methods: They manipulate an independent variable to look for an effect on a dependent variable. The goal of this method is to make strong causal claims about the impact of one variable on the other. 

experimental method: Research methodology that involves the manipulation of independent variables to determine their effects on the dependent variables.

##### The Challenge to Objectivity

For example, you might predict, and demonstrate experimentally, that the viewing of television violence leads to high levels of aggression. But how can you know that it was precisely the viewing of violence that produced aggression? To make the strongest possible case for their hypotheses, psychologists must be very sensitive to the existence of possible alternative explanations.

When something other than what an experimenter purposely introduces into a research setting changes a participant’s behavior and adds confusion to the interpretation of the data, it is called a __confounding variable__. 

Unintentional __expectancy effects__ occur when a researcher or observer subtly communicates to the research participants the behaviors he or she expects to find, thereby producing the desired reaction. Under these circumstances, the experimenter’s expectations, rather than the independent variable, actually help trigger the observed reactions.

A __placebo effect__ occurs when experimental participants change their behavior in the absence of any kind of experimental manipulation. This concept originated in medicine to account for cases in which a patient’s health improved after he or she had received medication that was chemically inert or a treatment that was nonspecific. The placebo effect refers to an improvement in health or well-being related to the individual’s belief that the treatment will be effective. 

confounding variable: A stimulus other than the variable an experimenter explicitly introduces into a research setting that affects a participant’s behavior.

expectancy effect: Result that occurs when a researcher or observer subtly communicates to participants the kind of behavior he or she expects to find, hereby creating that expected reaction.

placebo effect: A change in behavior in the absence of an experimental manipulation. 

control procedure: Consistent procedure for giving instructions, scoring responses, and holding all other variables constant except those being systematically varied.

#####  The Remedy: Control Procedures

Researchers’ strategies are called control procedures—methods that attempt to hold constant all variables and conditions other than those related to the hypothesis being tested. In an experiment, instructions, room temperature, tasks, the way the researcher is dressed, time allotted, the way the responses are recorded, and many other details of the situation must be similar for all participants, to ensure that their experience is the same. The only differences in participants’ experiences should be those introduced by the independent variable. Let’s look at remedies for the specific confounding variables, expectancy and placebo effects.

Thus, in your experiment, we would want the research assistant who greeted the participants and later assessed their aggression to be unaware of whether they had watched a violent program or a comedy: We would keep the research assistant blind to the assignment of participants to conditions. In the best circumstances, bias can be eliminated by keeping both experimental assistants and participants blind to which aparticipants get which treatment. This technique is called a __double-blind control__. In our prospective aggression experiment, we couldn’t keep participants from knowing whether they had watched comedy or violence. However, we would take great care to ensure that they couldn’t guess that our later analyses would focus on their subsequent aggression.

To account for placebo effects, researchers generally include an experimental condition in which the treatment is not administered. This is a __placebo control__. Placebo controls fall into the general category of controls by which experimenters assure themselves they are making appropriate comparisons. On one task, people were asked to view a series of 20 pictures on a computer screen, name them, and later recall those names. The participants were 14 percent better at this task after six weeks of ginkgo. However, participants who took a placebo—a pill with no active ingredients—also improved by 14 percent. The placebo control suggests that improvement on the task was the result of practice from the initial session. The data from control conditions provide an important baseline against which the experimental effect is evaluated

#####  The Remedy: Research Designs

To implement control conditions, researchers make decisions about what type of research design best suits their goals. In some research designs, which are referred to as between-subjects designs, different groups of participants are randomly assigned, by chance procedures, to an experimental condition (exposed to one or more experimental treatments) or to a control condition (not exposed to an experimental treatment). 

Random assignment is one of the major steps researchers take to eliminate confounding variables that relate to individual differences among potential research participants. This is the procedure you’d want to use for the aggression experiment. The random assignment to experimental and control conditions makes it quite likely that the two groups will be similar in important ways at the start of an experiment because each participant has the same probability of being in a treatment condition as in a control condition. We shouldn’t have to worry, for example, that everyone in the experimental group loves violent television and everyone in the control group hates it. Random assignment should mix both types of people together in each group. If outcome differences are found between conditions, we can be more confident that the differences were caused by a treatment or intervention rather than by preexisting differences.

double-blind control: An experimental technique in which biased expectations of experimenters are eliminated by keeping both participants and experimental assistants unaware of which participants have received which treatment.

placebo control: An experimental condition in which treatment is not administered; it is used in cases where a placebo effect might occur. between-subjects design A research design in which different groups of participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions or to control conditions.

random assignment: A procedure by which participants have an equal likelihood of being assigned to any condition within an experiment. experimental group A group in an experiment that is exposed to a treatment or experiences a manipulation of the independent variable.

control group: A group in an experiment that is not exposed to a treatment or does not experience a manipulation of the independent variable.

population: The entire set of individuals to which generalizations will be made based on an experimental sample. sample A subset of a population selected as participants in an experiment.

representative sample: A subset of a population that closely matches the overall characteristics of the population with respect to the distribution of males and females, racial and ethnic groups, and so on.

random sampling: A procedure that ensures that every member of a population has an equal likelihood of participating in an experiment. Featured Study

within-subjects design: A research design that uses each participant as his or her own control; for example, the behavior of an experimental participant before receiving treatment might be compared to his or her behavior after receiving treatment.

First, during an experiment, behavior is frequently studied in an artificial environment, one in which situational factors are controlled so heavily that the environment may itself distort the behavior from the way it would occur naturally. Critics claim that much of the richness and complexity of natural behavior patterns is lost in controlled experiments, sacrificed to the simplicity of dealing with only one or a few variables and responses. Second, research participants typically know they are in an experiment and are being tested and measured. They may react to this awareness by trying to please the researcher, attempting to “psych out” the research purpose, or changing their behavior from what it would be if they were unaware of being monitored. Third, some important research problems are not amenable to ethical experimental treatment

#### Correlational Methods

These questions involve variables that a psychologist could not easily or ethically manipulate. To answer these questions, researchers carry out studies using correlational methods. Psychologists use correlational methods when they want to determine to what extent two variables, traits, or attributes are related

To determine the precise degree of correlation that exists between two variables, psychologists compute a statistical measure known as the correlation coefficient (r). This value can vary between 1.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation, 1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation, and 0.0 indicates no correlation at all

correlational method: Research methodology that determines to what extent two variables, traits, or attributes are related.

correlation coefficient: (r) A statistic that indicates the degree of relationship between two variables.

A strong correlation indicates only that two sets of data are related in a systematic way; the correlation does not ensure that one causes the other. Correlation does not imply causation. The correlation could reflect any one of several cause-and-effect possibilities. Many of those possibilities involve a third variable that works in the background to bring about the correlation. 


###  PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 28

Although some actions and processes are easily seen, many, such as anxiety or dreaming, are not. Thus one task for apsychological researcher is to make the unseen visible, to make internal events and processes external, and to make private experiences public. You have already seen how important it is for researchers to provide operational definitions of the phenomena they wish to study. Those definitions generally provide some procedure for assigning numbers to, or quantifying, different levels, sizes, intensities, or amounts of a variable. Many measurement methods are available, each with its particular advantages and disadvantages.


####  Achieving Reliability and Validity

Reliability refers to the consistency or dependability of behavioral data resulting from psychological testing or experimental research. A reliable result is one that will be repeated under similar conditions of testing at different times.

Validity means that the information produced by research or testing accurately measures the psychological variable or quality it is intended to measure. 

##### Self-Report Measures

Often researchers are interested in obtaining data about experiences they cannot directly observe. Sometimes these experiences are internal psychological states, such as beliefs, attitudes, and feelings. At other times, these experiences are external behaviors but—like sexual activities or criminal acts— not generally appropriate for psychologists to witness. In these cases, investigations rely on self-reports. Self-report measures are verbal answers, either written or spoken, to questions the researcher poses. Researchers devise reliable ways to quantify these self-reports so they can make meaningful comparisons between different individuals’ responses.

reliability: The degree to which a test produces similar scores each time it is used; stability or consistency of the scores produced by an instrument.

validity: The extent to which a test measures what it was intended to measure.

self-report: measure A self-behavior that is identified through a participant’s own observations and reports.

behavioral: measure Overt actions or reaction that is observed and recorded, exclusive of self-reported behavior


####  Self-Report: Measures Behavioral Measures and Observations

Behavioral measures are ways to study overt actions and observable and recordable reactions.

naturalistic observation:  A research technique in which unobtrusive observations are made of behaviors that occur in natural environments.

case study: Intensive observation of a particular individual or small group of individuals.

###  ETHICAL ISSUES IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL

####  Informed Consent 

At the start of nearly all laboratory research with human subjects, participants undergo a process of informed consent. They are informed about the procedures they will experience as well as the potential risks and benefits of participation. Given that information, participants are asked to sign a statement indicating that they consent to continue. a

####  Risk/Gain Assessment Intentional

Therefore, whenever a researcher conducts such a study, risks must be minimized, participants must be informed of the risks, and suitable
precautions must be taken to deal with strong reactions. 

####  Deception Debriefing

####  Issues in Animal Research

Ethicists encourage researchers to adhere to the three Rs: Researchers should devise tests of their hypothesis that enable them to reduce the number of animals they require or to replace the use of animals altogether; they should refine their procedures to minimize pain and distress (Ryder, 2006). Each animal researcher must judge his or her work with heightened scrutiny

informed consent: The process through which individuals are informed about experimental procedures, risks, and benefits before they provide formal consent to become research participants.

debriefing: A procedure conducted at the end of an experiment in which the researcher provides the participant with as much information about the study as possible and makes sure that no participant leaves feeling confused, upset, or embarrassed.


###  BECOMING A CRITICAL CONSUMER OF RESEARCH 34

To be a critical thinker is to go beyond the information as given and to delve beneath slick appearances, with the goal of understanding the substance without being seduced by style and image.

Studying psychology will help you make wiser decisions based on scientific evidence. Always try to apply the insights you derive from your formal study of psychology to the informal psychology that surrounds you: Ask questions about your own behavior or that of other people, seek answers to these questions with respect to rational psychological theories, and check out the answers against the evidence available to you.

__Here are some general rules to keep in mind to be a more sophisticated shopper as you travel through the supermarket of knowledge:__

Avoid the inference that correlation is causation.

Ask that critical terms and key concepts be defined operationally so that there can be consensus about their meanings.

Consider first how to disprove a theory, hypothesis, or belief before seeking confirming evidence, which is easy to find when you’re looking for a justification.

Always search for alternative explanations to the obvious ones proposed, especially when the explanations benefit the proposer.

Recognize how personal biases can distort perceptions of reality.

Be suspicious of simple answers to complex questions or single causes and cures for complex effects and problems.

Question any statement about the effectiveness of some treatment, intervention, or product by finding the comparative basis for the effect: compared to what?

Be open-minded yet skeptical: Recognize that most conclusions are tentative and not certain; seek new evidence that decreases your uncertainty while keeping yourself open to change and revision.

Challenge authority that uses personal opinion in place of evidence for conclusions and is not open to constructive criticism.

###  RECAPPING MAIN POINTS 35

#### The Process of Research

In the initial phase of research, observations, beliefs, information, and general knowledge lead to a new way of thinking about a phenomenon. The researcher formulates a theory and generates hypotheses to be tested.

To test their ideas, researchers use the scientific method, a set of procedures for gathering and interpreting evidence in ways that limit errors.

Researchers combat observer biases by standardizing procedures and using operational definitions.

Experimental research methods determine whether causal relationships exist between variables specified by the hypothesis being tested.

Researchers rule out alternative explanations by using appropriate control procedures.

Correlational research methods determine if and how much two variables are related. Correlations do not imply causation.

####  Psychological Measurement

Researchers strive to produce measures that are both reliable and valid.

Psychological measurements include self-reports and behavioral measures.

####  Ethical Issues in Human and Animal Research

Respect for the basic rights of human and animal research participants is the obligation of all researchers. Various safeguards have been enacted to guarantee ethical and humane treatment.

####  Becoming a Critical Consumer of Research

Becoming a wise research consumer involves learning how to think critically and knowing how to evaluate claims about what research shows.

## Statistical Supplement
Understanding Statistics: Analyzing Data and Forming Conclusions

As Chapter 2 noted, psychologists use statistics to make sense of the data they collect. They also use statistics to provide a quantitative basis for the conclusions they draw. 

Descriptive statistics use mathematical procedures in an objective, uniform way to describe different aspects of numerical data. 

Inferential statistics use probability theory to make sound decisions about which results might have occurred simply through chance variation.

descriptive statistics: Statistical procedures that are used to summarize sets of scores with respect to central tendencies, variability, and correlations. 

inferential statistics: Statistical procedures that allow researchers to determine whether the results they obtain support their hypotheses or can be attributed just to chance variation.
###  Descriptive Statistics
#### Frequency Distributions

####  Graphs

####  Measures of Central Tendency

A single representative score that can be used as an index of the most typical score obtained by a group of participants is called a measure of central tendency. (It is located in the center of the distribution, and other scores tend to cluster around it.) Typically, psychologists use three different measures of central tendency: the mode, the median, and the mean.

measure of central tendency: A statistic, such as a mean, median, or mode, that provides one score as representative of a set of
observations.

mode: The score appearing most frequently in a set of observations; a measure of central tendency.

median: The score in a distribution above and below which lie 50 percent of the other scores; a measure of central tendency.

mean: The arithmetic average of a group of scores; the most commonly used measure of central tendency.

Variability

Measures of variability are statistics that describe the distribution of scores around some measure of central tendency.

The simplest measure of variability is the range, the difference between the highest and the lowest values in a frequency distribution.

standard deviation

measure of variability: A statistic, such as a range or standard deviation,
that indicates how tightly the scores in a set of observations cluster
together.

range: The difference between the highest and the lowest scores in a set
of observations; the simplest measure of variability.

standard deviation (SD): The average difference of a set of scores from
their mean; a measure of variability.

###  Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics are used to answer these kinds of questions. They tell us which inferences we can make from our samples and which conclusions we can legitimately draw from our data. Inferential statistics use probability theory to determine the likelihood that a set of data occurred simply by chance variation.

####  The Normal Curve 

####  Statistical Significance

correlational coefficient (r)： A statistic that indicates the degree of
relationship between two variables.

normal curve： The symmetrical curve that represents the distribution of
scores on many psychological attributes; allows researchers to make
judgments of how unusual an observation or result is.

By common agreement, psychologists accept a difference as “real” when the probability that it might be due to chance is less than 5 in 100 (indicated by the notation p  .05). A significant difference is one that meets this criterion. 

the t-test, which may be used when an investigator wants to know if the difference between the means of two groups is statistically significant.

significant difference: A difference between experimental groupsor conditions that would have occurred by chance less than an accepted criterion; in psychology, the criterion most often used is a probability of less than 5 times out of 100, or p  .05.

###  BECOMING A WISE CONSUMER OF STATISTICS

There are many ways to give a misleading impression using statistics. The decisions made at all stages of research— from who the participants are to how the study is designed, what statistics are selected, and how they are used—can have a profound effect on the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.

The group of participants can make a large difference that can easily remain undetected when the results are reported.

Even if the participants are randomly selected and not biased by the methodology, the statistics can produce misleading results if the assumptions of the statistics are violated

One good way to avoid falling for this sort of deception is to check on the size of the sample. Large samples are less likely to be misleading than small ones. Another check is to look at the median or the mode as well as the mean. 

## 3 The Biological and Evolutionary Bases of Behavior

### HEREDITY AND BEHAVIOR

#### Evolution and Natural Selection

##### Natural Selection
natural selection： Darwin’s theory that favorable adaptations to features
of the environment allow some members of a species to reproduce
more successfully than others.

survival of the fittest

##### genotype phenotype
genotype： The genetic structure an organism inherits from its parents.

phenotype： The observable characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction between the organism’s genotype and its environment.

##### Human Evolution
Instead of learning every one of life’s lessons firsthand, by trial and error, humans could benefit from experiences shared by others. Conversation, even humor, would strengthen the social bonds among members of a naturally gregarious species. Most important, the advent of language would provide for the transmission of accumulated wisdom, from one generation to future generations.

Language is the basis for cultural evolution, which is the tendency of cultures to respond adaptively, through learning, to environmental change.

##### Variation in the Human Genotype

The study of the mechanisms of heredity—the inheritance of physical and psychological traits from ancestors—is called genetics (Carlson, 2004).

###### Basic Genetics

heredity: The biological transmission of traits from parents to offspring.

genetics: The study of the inheritance of physical and psychological traits from ancestors.

human behavior genetics: The area of study that evaluates the genetic component of individual differences in behaviors and traits.

sociobiology: A field of research that focuses on evolutionary explanations for the social behavior and social systems of humans and other animal species.

evolutionary psychology: The study of behavior and mind using the principles of evolutionary theory.

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid): The physical basis for the transmission of genetic information.

gene: The biological unit of heredity; discrete section of a chromosome responsible for transmission of traits.

sex chromosome: Chromosome that contains the genes that code for the development of male or female characteristics.

###### Heritability

To achieve the goal of understanding the functions of genes, research in human behavior genetics often focuses on estimating the heritability of particular human traits and behaviors. Heritability is measured on a scale of 0 to 1. If an estimate is near 0, it suggests that the attribute is largely a product of environmental influences; if an estimate is near 1, it suggests that the attribute is largely a product of genetic influences.

polygenic trait: Characteristic that is influenced by more than one gene.
genome: The genetic information for an organism, stored in the DNA of its chromosomes.
heritability: The relative influence of genetics—versus environment—in determining patterns of behavior.

###### Interactions of Genes and Environments

a contrast between nature and nurture as causal
forces in people’s lives. However, researchers have increasingly
come to document that both genetics and environments play
critical roles to determine organisms’ behaviors.

A1: Definition: scientific, behavior, individual, and mental. 
Goal: Discribe what happens, Explain what happens, Predict what will happen, Control what will happen.
Q2结构主义和机能主义的差异在哪？
A2: 结构主义倾向于把行为和思维过程看做成基本单元的组合，而机能主义更强调行为背后的目的，也就是功能。
Q3请梳理本章提到的心理学家的名字，并用一句话总结各自的最大贡献/成就。
A3:  Wilhelm Wundt founded the first formal laboratory
devoted to experimental psychology.
Mary Whiton Calkins. In 1905, she became the first woman president of
the American Psychological Association.
In 1894, Margaret Floy Washburn (1871–1939) graduated
from Cornell University to become the first woman to receive
a PhD in psychology. 
Q4请总结心理动力学，行为主义以及人本主义的流派与视角区别。
A4: 心理动力学最开始起源于弗洛伊德对其病人的研究，主要观点是来自于父母的潜意识投射在子女身上，从而导致了该行为。行为主义强调环境刺激导致了行为的发生。人本主义强调自身的个性、价值观、目标驱动行为的发生，直至满足个体的需求。

Q7你认为你是一个有创造性想法的人么？你的新想法是怎么来的？
A7: 我不是一个有创造性想法的人，因为我的很多想法很可能是从哪里看到哪个人说过的，然后我忘了这回事，直接拿来用了。自己平时思考的少，涉世未深，对很多事情缺少实际的体验，空想和实际的体验还是有很大的差距的。
Q8在P23页中，对比心理学问题的研究流程，你的学习流程有什么缺项，你有什么启发？
A8: 我自己的学习关键是缺乏系统性，没有去严谨的设计实验来评估学习的效果，只是自己想到了，就跑去学习，学习完全看心情，很随性。心理学的研究流程是观察思考->提出假说->设计实验、排除干扰因素->解释实验。而我的流程是生活遇到挫折->我要学习->学习停滞->接着学习->学习停滞...缺乏对结果的验证，学习开始之前没有对自己真正的问题进行分析，自己到底应该进行哪种学习，先解决最重要的那个问题，即先搞定80%，再慢慢搞定20%.
Q9人们看见的和听见的只是他们所预期的，而不是事实的本来面目。你自己是否有做过类似的事情？并且为此付出了代价。试举一例
A9: 比如，自己很喜欢采用预设立场来思考别人的行为、话语，认为某某人这么做是因为“XXX”，因此他根本就没有考虑我的利益。这和我对生活的理解太少有关，也和我不断对自己放松警惕、对自己放松要求有关，所以最终后果是，赚到的钱比同学少很多，生活要无聊很多，朋友要少很多。
Q10研究者采取什么样的步骤克服观察者偏见？
A10: 观察者偏见分为，期望效应、安慰剂效应，如果采取双盲实验的话，可以有效解决这个观察者偏见的问题，实验的参与者不知道自己接受的哪种对待方案，实验的研究员也不知道哪一组是实验组，哪一组是控制组。
Q11在生活中你是否挑战过一些权威观点？你是如何思考的？
A11: 我一般不敢挑战权威，因为自己思考的少，学习的少，感觉自己没有资格再去评论什么，因为害怕在公众面前出丑，害怕暴露自己的无知，但是对于那些自己所知甚少的领域，在一些非权威面前，我又成为了另一个“权威”，能够娓娓道来。我要改掉这个毛病，多思考，思考是否这个观点可以被否定，搜集更多的证据，多做事，少比比。
Q12什么是T检验？
A12: T检验是统计学中用来检验两个变量之间相关的程度的一个函数，0为不相关，1为高度相关。因为实际的情况会更复杂，实验取得的数据只能解释这两个因素之间的相关性，而不是因果。
Q13统计样本的情况时，什么时候适合用平均数？什么时候适合用中位数？
A13: 比如描述平均收入、生活水平的时候，更适合用中位数，因为极值的影响太大了。当极值的影响不是很大，数据呈现某种正态分布的 规律状态时，用平均数是比较合适的。

Q14如果信息社会发展下去，你认为人会进化出什么样的新特性？
A14: 我认为人的大脑的分量会越来越大，其它四肢的作用将会变小，参考美国士兵的半自动骨骼，我们将更多的借助外力来拓展我们人体本身的局限。大脑里的沟回将会增多，白质、灰质增多，对于现代出现的高科技，可能我们的后代天生就会遗传到相关使用的基因，比如编程相关的基因，很有可能小孩子就可以无障碍的开始学编程了，那些我们大学专业才开始学的东西，将会推前。以后的人对于现在出现的高科技，会表现成更好的适应性，更快学习、更快上手。
Q15神经递质是如何从一个神经元到另一个神经元的？
A15: 突触前（presynaptic）神经元负责合成神经递质（一般来说，只需要简单地几步即可生物合成），并将其包裹在突触小泡（synaptic vesicle）内，在神经元发生冲动时，突触小泡通过胞吐作用，将其中的神经递质释放到突触间隙（synaptic cleft）中。通过扩散作用神经递质分子抵达突触后（postsynaptic）细胞膜，并与其上的一系列受体通道结合，起到改变通道蛋白构相、激活第二信使系统等作用，进而导致突触后神经元的电位或代谢等变化。

Q16关于大脑可塑性的描述，你有什么启发？
A17: 脑可塑是指大脑可以为环境和经验所修饰，具有在外界环境和经验的作用下塑造大脑结构和功能的能力，分为结构可塑和功能可塑。脑的结构可塑是指大脑内部的突触、神经元之间的连接可以由于学习和经验的影响建立新的连接，从而影响个体的行为。它包括突触可塑和神经元可塑。功能的可塑性可以理解为通过学习和训练，大脑某一代表区的功能可以由邻近的脑区代替，也表现为脑损伤患者在经过学习、训练后脑功能在一定程度上的恢复。[百度百科]
大脑可塑=>人可塑=>你可塑=>环境可塑+思想可塑
当一个人还比较弱小的时候,需要先适应环境,让自己先生存下来.解决了基本的生活需求后,就应该向更高的层次发展,发展出自己的特长---即我擅长什么,为什么老板选择我而不选择他.拓展自己的思想,从知识的丰富海洋里汲取营养(多读几本大部头,打通任督二脉),重塑自己的思想,结合具体的行动,用丰富的情景双重刺激大脑.在一定程度上有了说话的权利(某个领域),再去寻求环境的改变---跳到更牛逼的平台,或者自己造一个合适的土壤(创业),最终回到大脑的可塑,形成一个闭环.
