# React Native

## What is React Native?
React Native is used to develop mobile apps using JavaScript, i.e. learn once, write everywhere. The javascript code will finally be compiled to native code. so it is not a web app or hrbrid app, it is a native app.

e.g.
div->android-view->uiview-><View>
input->                  -><TextInput>
    ...
and so on
